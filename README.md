1. Hello world with parameter

   Create a web page which displays "Hello <name>" where <name> is set in the URL.

   Implement using <resource-url>?name=<name>
   Implement using <resource-url>/<name>

2. Floating widgets

   Create a web page with one or more widgets, which keep their relative position to the browser window (and to each other), no matter how the browser is sized.

   Examples:

   A single widget which stays in the center of the window
   A group of widgets positioned around the center, their distance being proportional to the browser size
   Use an url parameter to set the number of widgets and arrange them into a square pattern (with "holes" if needed)

   Don't use JavaScript for positioning!
